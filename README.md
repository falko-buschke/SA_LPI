# Calculating a national Living Planet Index for South Africa

This repository contains the code and data to replicated the results from the manuscript:

* Buschke, F.T. & von Staden, L. (In preparation). The South African Living Planet Index shows the value of a supposedly ‘uninformative’ indicator.

Its content was accurate as of 05 June 2024. For any enquiries, please contact `falko.buschk@gmail.com`.

## Input data
### General data
Analyses were based on the 2022 public version of the [Living Planet Database](https://www.livingplanetindex.org/data_portal), which includes 32,680 population time-series from 4,923 species. We filtered this dataset to only include time-series from South Africa, resulting in a national dataset with 560 time-series from 244 species.

### Supplementary data
We supplemented information from the global dataset, by including high-quality census data from 13 provincial protected areas from the Free State Province. This included data of 184 populations from 27 species. **Population data for black and white rhinoceroses are excluded from the version of the dataset shared in this repository, because this information should remain confidential.**
